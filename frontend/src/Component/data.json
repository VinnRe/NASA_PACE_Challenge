Educational Use: Biodiversity Lessons: Show how different phytoplankton species contribute to ocean health, how they thrive in different conditions, and their role in the marine food web. Climate and Environmental Change: Teach about how environmental changes (temperature, nutrient availability) affect phytoplankton populations and consequently marine ecosystems. Interactive Maps: Develop tools to map phytoplankton diversity across different regions allowing learners to compare ocean zones and their biological richness."
